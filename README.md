Pirate Engine Prototype 2
=========================

This is the second prototype of the Pirate Engines new implementation.
Now we work with JSFML, the wrapper to SFML. So we work with OpenGL and
can provide much more performance and features.

The Pirate Engine is an easy to use 2D Engine for Java Decvelopers. The
entire Engine is implemented in Java except the underlying Renderer from
SFML. But SFML or JSFML provides all common operating systems like Windows
(both 32 and 64 bit), Linux (also 32 and 64 bit) and Mac.

If you want to build this source, you need the JSFML Dependency. You can
get it here: http://jsfml.org/?page=download

Note, that the current Code is based on the JSFML release from July 31, 2013.

Tutorials to the Pirate Engine will follow, if we are ready to release something.
